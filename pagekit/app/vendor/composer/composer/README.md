Composer - Dependency Management for PHP
========================================

Composer helps you declare, manage and install dependencies of PHP projects, ensuring you have the right stack everywhere.

See [https://getcomposer.org/](https://getcomposer.org/) for more information and documentation.

Installation / Usage
--------------------

1. Download the [`composer.phar`](https://getcomposer.org/composer.phar) executable or use the installer.

    ``` sh
    $ curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
    ```

2. Create a composer.json defining your dependencies. Note that this example is
a short version for applications that are not meant to be published as packages
themselves. To create libraries/packages please read the
[documentation](https://getcomposer.org/doc/02-libraries.md).

    ``` json
    {
        "require": {
            "monolog/monolog": ">=1.0.0"
        }
    }
    ```

3. Run Composer: `php composer.phar install`
4. Browse for more packages on [Packagist](https://packagist.org).
